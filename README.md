# RealWaste Image Classification

## Introduction
The RealWaste Image Classification project represents a pivotal step towards integrating technology with environmental sustainability. Developed as a comprehensive solution to the challenges of waste management and recycling, this project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to classify waste items accurately. By automating the sorting process, we aim to enhance recycling rates and reduce the environmental impact of waste.

## Project Objectives
- **Innovate Waste Management**: Apply cutting-edge image classification models to revolutionize the traditional waste sorting process.
- **Sustainability**: Contribute to environmental sustainability by improving recycling efficiency and minimizing landfill usage.
- **Technical Showcase**: Demonstrate proficiency in machine learning, data preprocessing, and image processing techniques.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: PyTorch/TensorFlow (for deep learning), OpenCV (for image processing), Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation), `timm` (for accessing state-of-the-art pre-trained models).
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset Overview
This project uses a curated dataset of waste item images, classified into multiple categories such as plastics, metals, cardboard, and more. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure a robust evaluation of the model's performance.

## Model Architecture
Utilizing the latest advancements in deep learning, the project employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture optimized for image classification tasks. The model leverages transfer learning, utilizing a pre-trained model from `timm` as the foundation, which is further fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy on the waste classification dataset.

## Implementation Highlights
- **Custom Dataset Handling**: Development of a `CustomDataset` class for efficient data loading and preprocessing, tailored to the specific needs of waste image classification.
- **Advanced Training Techniques**: Implementation of state-of-the-art training methodologies, including data augmentation, learning rate scheduling, and regularization, to enhance model performance.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Rigorous evaluation of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, providing insights into its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
